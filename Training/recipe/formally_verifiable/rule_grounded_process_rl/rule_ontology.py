- IMPLICATION_ELIMINATION: from A -> B and support for A, derive the entire consequent B.
- MODUS_TOLLENS: from A -> B and support for not B, derive not A (including a justified component of a compound A).
- EXCLUSIVE_DISJUNCTION_INTRODUCTION: from A and not B, or from not A and B, derive A XOR B.
- EXCLUSIVE_DISJUNCTION_ELIMINATION: from A XOR B plus one known branch or its negation, derive the forced other branch or its negation.
- DISJUNCTIVE_SYLLOGISM: from A OR B and not A derive B, or from A OR B and not B derive A.
- CONJUNCTION_INTRODUCTION: from A and B derive A AND B.
- CONJUNCTION_ELIMINATION: from A AND B derive A or derive B.
- UNIVERSAL_ELIMINATION: instantiate a universally quantified formula for one concrete entity.
- GOAL_BINDING: only for a final_answer action whose id and conclusion exactly match an answer option.

The rule must describe the operation that produces the declared conclusion. If an implication first activates a compound consequent and the same action then selects one XOR/OR/AND branch, use the corresponding elimination rule, not IMPLICATION_ELIMINATION. Do not invent rule names, aliases, abbreviations, or alternative capitalization."""
